In the modern world, depression has become a major problem for the society and it is increasing
day by day. Depression is resulting in a lot of deaths and has become a hurdle for people who
wants a normal happy life. People usually share their feelings and emotions through the social
media platform. We have developed a desktop application that can help the educational
institutions or corporations to identify the presence of probable depression level by analyzing
their tweets or extracting the emotions from the facial expressions of the students or employees
respectively. We have assigned different percentages to the different probable depression levels.
The tweets of the user are classified into positive and negative tweets based on the different
metrics. The admin of the system can scrape the tweets from the twitter account of the user and
apply sentimental analysis for the prediction of the probable depression level. The admin can
also predict the probable depression level from the facial expressions of the user and compare the
results with each other. The manager can record the live stream of the user and can generate
monthly or yearly reports of the people to statistically analyze the results. We have compared the
results generated from the CNN model with the logistic regression model. This can help the
organizations to predict the probable depression level beforehand and take necessary precautions
so that the person develops a better personality. This project is very beneficial for the society
because now a days most of the people are depressed due to various reasons and their post on
social media directly effects the society.
